# Lego Photo Maker
A tool to generate Lego versions of photographs, based on Lego's Mosaic Maker from their London store.

## Converting an image
Currently, it converts an image to Lego greyscale (White, Light Bluish Grey, Dark Bluish Grey, Black).
The converted image is saved as `output.jpg`, and corresponding [bricklink xml](https://www.bricklink.com/help.asp?helpID=207) is saved as `output.xml`.

## Command line arguments
Currently, the program just takes the input photo's filename as an argument.
